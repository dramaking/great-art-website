							<p>Frances Hodgkins was the outstanding artist of her generation, with a professional life that spanned 56 years and earned her a secure place among the English avant-garde of the 1930s and 1940s: the first New Zealand-born artist to achieve such stature. Her role in the transmission of ideas from Paris to London has yet to be fully documented. She was also one of the women artists who, by their example of single minded dedication to career, challenged the category 'lady artist' with all its connotations of curtailed achievement. </p>
							<p>Throughout a long life divided between two hemispheres Frances Hodgkins wrote hundreds of letters to her family. In one of these, sent to her mother during a crisis in 1924, she discussed her situation as an expatriate and her struggle not only as an artist but as a woman artist:</p>

It requires enormous vitality. That is my conception of genius-vitality."</p>

							<p>Frances Hodgkins grew up in the southernmost of New Zealand's main centres, the third child of an English-born solicitor and his Australian wife. She attended private schools and, following the example of her father and sister, sketched from childhood onwards. About 1885, after several earlier moves, the family shifted to Ravensbourne, a quiet suburb on the shores of Otago Harbour. Here, with her elder sister Isabel and her four brothers, Frances passed her adolescent years.</p>

							<p>In 1889, financial losses forced the Hodgkins family to leave Ravensbourne and rent Cranmore Lodge on the hills above the city. A year later Frances began to exhibit, but her career as a serious artist dates from 1893 when she took lessons from the Italian painter G. P. Nerli. In 1895 she attended the Dunedin School of Art and a year later began teaching. After W. M. Hodgkins died in 1898 the family broke up and Frances decided to travel overseas. She set out for Europe in February 1901.</p>

							<p>Frances intended to be abroad twelve months or so; in fact she stayed away nearly three years. Falling under the spell of the old world, she travelled widely with Miss D. K. Richmond and other friends. She painted industriously and succeeded in having work shown in the Royal Academy and in three London galleries. On her return to New Zealand she took a studio in Bowen Street, Wellington. But, unhappy in her personal life and disillusioned with the colony, she sailed once more for Europe in January 1906.</p>

							<p>The second European visit was again planned for a year but lengthened into seven. After extensive travels and her first one man show in London, Frances established herself in Paris. There she built up a modest reputation as watercolourist and teacher. When she embarked for New Zealand in October 1912 it was not to settle but to see her family and show her work. In October 1913, following highly successful exhibitions in Australia and New Zealand, she left to continue her career in Europe.</p>
